<h1 id="introduction-dont-skip">Introduction (don’t skip)</h1>
<p>You are good at games. You understand games. Games have rules.
Predictable, deterministic, if-this-then-that rules. If the rules are
clear, you can play it.</p>
<p>Some games are “perfect knowledge”, meaning no hidden information.
Some games let players keep secrets. Some games have random outcomes.
Some games even have rules that change as you go.</p>
<p>I’m going to ask you to entertain a wild idea. I want you to think of
the modern workplace as a game, in which you are a professional player.
How do you keep score? Who are your allies and opponents? What
constitutes a foul, and what are the penalties?</p>
<p>When you sit down to a complex board game, you have certain
expectations. Some resources will be easier to acquire, some less. A
player may stiff you on a trade, or play suboptimally. That’s OK. Your
own self-worth is intact. It’s just a game.</p>
<p>In the pages that follow, I will reveal the hidden rules and unstated
social physics of the corporate performance appraisal game. If you treat
it with the same detached curiosity you bring to other gaming, you’ll be
fine. If you tie your self worth to <em>being right</em>, well, it’s
going to be more difficult.</p>
<p>Just like in other professional sports, how you play has an impact on
your greater life. Most directly in terms of comp, but also in terms of
reputation, future opportunities, social sphere, mental health, etc. And
so playing ethically is the rational move. But so may be the occasional
strategic light foul.</p>
<p>The point is that you must separate your <strong>private
ledger</strong>, what you think of as right and true and just, from the
<strong>firm ledger</strong>, how the company (the firm) values your
contributions.</p>
<p>It’s not that your ethics don’t matter at all. It’s that if you
choose to commit a game-suboptimal play to satisfy your ethical frame,
or vice versa, I want you to do it with eyes wide open. But to do that,
you first have to understand the game you’re already playing, which
we’ll explore thoroughly.</p>
<p>One final warning before we proceed: <em>you will feel
manipulative</em>. We’ve been brought up to believe that unconscious
prosocial behavior is “good” while conscious prosocial behavior is
“suspicious / manipulative” etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to explain the rules and physics of the corporate
appraisal game, this text must make social behavior and communication
strategies <strong>explicit</strong>. Some players are naturals. You can
think of our approach as going from vibes to debugger. Assistive
technology for the empathetically disinclined.</p>
<p>Oh, and at the risk of undermining my own authority, I have <em>never
been promoted within a company</em>. I don’t believe in it.
Strategically, the firm has every incentive to withhold increases in
comp and level as long as possible.</p>
<p>So while I’ve worked in every size org from tiny startups to Big
Tech, from academia to non-profit to B2B SaaS, I’ve found it way easier
to boost my pay by hopping to a competitor, than to stay and grind it
out for scraps.</p>
<p>But if that’s you, no worries, the frameworks and techniques we’ll
develop here work equally well for effort minimization or outcome
maximization. Just pick a lane and play accordingly.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get on with our goal of mapping the
firm’s real moral and status drivers. This will reduce confusion, reduce
unfair self-blame, and increase the karmic ROI of genuinely prosocial
behavior.</p>
<h1 id="karmarank-origin-story-with-math">KarmaRank: Origin Story (with
Math)</h1>
<h2 id="the-toy-demo-and-the-wrong-scoreboard">1. The Toy Demo and the
Wrong Scoreboard</h2>
<p>In that cold fishbowl conference room, my manager looked decidedly
displeased. Her face was flushed, which was saying something for someone
normally so amiable. The face of you’re-about-to-get-PIP’d.</p>
<p>I rubbed my wrist, sore from days of furious typing. I’d been getting
in early and staying late, trying to wrestle my codebase into something
that met all the requirements. Somehow, it still wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it yet, but we were playing by two different
scoreboards.</p>
<hr />
<p>It all started a few weeks earlier, when I built a cool little
demo.</p>
<p>It was a novel data visualization for one very specific dataset. On
that one dataset, it looked great. You could project it in a meeting and
everyone would nod and go, “Wow, that’s neat.”</p>
<p>My managers liked it. Then they did the obvious manager thing: “Can
you make this work for arbitrary datasets?”</p>
<p>I said yes, because of course I did. In hindsight, that was insane.
Data comes in all shapes, sizes, and pathologies. Turning a bespoke
showpiece into a robust, general system is a whole other level.</p>
<p>I started working, and in my head, I was optimizing for
<strong>my</strong> scoreboard: clean abstractions, maintainable code, a
system I wouldn’t be ashamed to revisit in six months. I was chasing the
feeling of having built something elegant and general.</p>
<p>My manager, it turned out, was optimizing for a different scoreboard
entirely, one I hadn’t fully seen yet.</p>
<h2 id="hr-doxa-vs-what-she-actually-meant">2. HR Doxa vs What She
Actually Meant</h2>
<p>As the weeks ticked by and the generalized version stubbornly refused
to be “done,” my manager started leaning on me with what I now recognize
as <strong>HR doxa</strong>—language whose literal content is less
important than its emotional payload.</p>
<p>She would say things like, “You need to focus on priorities,” and
“How can I help?”</p>
<p>Being an engineer, I interpreted these word-sounds at face value.
When she asked how she could help, I went away and made a groomed
backlog. I put together a spreadsheet of <strong>features</strong>,
<strong>estimates</strong>, and <strong>priorities</strong>, then walked
into our 1:1 with an ordered list, ready to talk tradeoffs and timelines
like a grown-up product owner.</p>
<p>She glanced at it, eyes glazed, then back to me.</p>
<p>Not angrily. It just didn’t register as <em>relevant data</em>. I’d
brought her a beautifully formatted map of the territory
<strong>I</strong> cared about: architecture, features, technical
sequence. She lived in a different terrain entirely: <strong>people,
stories, moods, status</strong>.</p>
<p>From her point of view, that spreadsheet was beside the point until
there was at least one human somewhere in the org saying, “This helped
us.” Until there was a real person, in a real team, with a real story,
the internal structure of my backlog was just décor.</p>
<p>We were using the same words—focus, priorities, help—to play two
different games. I thought we were collaborating on how to architect a
nice piece of software. She was trying to succeed at <strong>being my
manager in an org that cares about certain metrics and not
others</strong>. That mismatch simmered for a while.</p>
<h2 id="the-objective-function-reveals-itself">3. The Objective Function
Reveals Itself</h2>
<p>Eventually the tension boiled over.</p>
<p>Back in the cold fishbowl, she came to our 1:1 visibly frustrated,
face flushed—the kind of affect where you can tell someone has been
defending you in other rooms and is running out of narrative. An amiable
woman with a slight frame, it took a lot for her to become visibly
flustered.</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Look, in two weeks I and <other manager> are going to <corp HQ> for
a meeting with &lt;boss’s boss&gt;. We need to be able to tell them
<strong>who your software has helped and how</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And suddenly, the room tilted.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>There it was: the <strong>actual objective function</strong>, finally
stated in plain language.</p>
<p>The key questions were not, “Is the architecture future-proof?” or
“Is the codebase beautiful?” The key questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Who has this helped?</strong>” (concrete users)</li>
<li>“<strong>How?</strong>” (a story you can tell in a meeting)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that was constrained by a simple deadline: “In time for that
HQ meeting, two weeks from now.”</p>
<p>In that moment, my entire understanding of “value” in that context
snapped into focus. My personal value system—maintainable code,
generality, elegance—was a <strong>proxy</strong>. The institution’s
value system, at least for this project, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do I have success stories I can say out loud to high-status
people, on this date?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="optimizing-for-the-real-metric">4. Optimizing for the Real
Metric</h2>
<p>Once I understood the metric, it was optimizable.</p>
<p>I stopped trying to engineer a perfectly general system and started
treating the next two weeks as a <strong>bounded experiment</strong>
with a clear payoff: generate at least one, preferably two, credible
success stories attached to real users before the HQ meeting.</p>
<p>I cut an alpha build of the tool, ignoring what to me were glaring
bugs in the design and went fully white glove. I reached out to
potential teams in the building with data visualization problems. I
plugged in their data and made hasty changes to fix <strong>their
specific issues</strong>.</p>
<p>I parked myself at collaborators’ desks while they poked around so I
could gauge their responses. When the tool broke, I hacked in quick,
local fixes. When it sort of worked, I stayed just long enough to make
sure they could tell a coherent “this helped us do X” story later,
without me in the room.</p>
<p>Within those two weeks, I snagged two concrete success stories—things
like, “Team A used this to finally see Y, which unblocked Z,” and “Team
B used this visualization to explain W to their stakeholders.” The exact
details don’t matter; what mattered was that they were legible and
repeatable.</p>
<p>The HQ meeting was a success. My manager’s affect flipped from
flushed frustration to relieved pride. From the outside, the story
became, “this guy finally focused and delivered.” From the inside, the
story was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I finally found the <strong>real scoreboard</strong> and stopped
optimizing for my private one.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="writing-down-the-algorithm-net-status-weighted-karma">5. Writing
Down the Algorithm: Net Status-Weighted Karma</h2>
<p>I was so pleased with myself for decoding the game that I did what I
always do when I think I’ve spotted a pattern: I tried to turn it into
math. In my notebook, I wrote down a simple expression for what I’d just
experienced:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K = \sum_{i} S_i \cdot k_i
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is your <strong>Net
Status-Weighted Karma</strong> in a given field: a company, a team, a
subculture, a community.</p>
<p>The index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> ranges over the
people whose opinions about you actually <strong>travel</strong>—your
manager, your manager’s peers, the Staff engineer everyone listens to,
the PM who won’t shut up in calibration meetings.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/net-status-weighted-karma.png"
alt="Net Status-Weighted Karma Equation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Net Status-Weighted Karma
Equation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For each such person, <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> is
your <strong>karma with person</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>: the signed “emotional value” they get
from telling a story about you and your work.</p>
<ul>
<li>A positive <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> is, “She saved
our launch with that tool.”</li>
<li>A negative <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> is, “He keeps
slipping deadlines and making excuses.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The last term, <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>, is their
<strong>Status</strong> in this field—capital <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on purpose, because it’s the most
important term. It’s not just job title, but their actual ability to
move decisions and narratives as it pertains <em>to you</em>. It’s a
weight: how much their stories about you count when they reach the
people who allocate promotions, opportunities, and resources.</p>
<p>The implications are brutally simple. Helping a lot of low-Status
people a little versus helping a few high-Status people a lot can
produce the same Net Karma. From a purely karmic ROI perspective, it is
<strong>cheaper</strong> to create one ecstatic director than ten mildly
satisfied ICs. One well-placed success story can outweigh a dozen quiet
“yeah, it’s fine”s lower in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>That’s what I’d just done, accidentally. I hadn’t “improved the
codebase” in some abstract, global sense. I had improved my <strong>Net
Karma</strong> by creating a couple of high-weight <span
class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> nodes who could now tell positive
stories (<span class="math inline">\(k_i &gt; 0\)</span>) about me in a
critical meeting.</p>
<h2 id="showing-my-manager-the-formula">6. Showing My Manager the
Formula</h2>
<p>Pleased with my little equation, I showed it to my manager.</p>
<p>I explained, cheerfully, something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Look, I get it now. My value to the org is basically the sum over
people of how much they like telling stories about me, weighted by their
status. So my job is to create high-status, positive storytellers.
That’s what I optimized for with the alpha.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>This was bad. Silence from an amiable person is a sign of deep
disagreement or distress.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the kind of distress you get when the math is wrong. It was
the kind you get when someone has said the quiet part out loud. Her
expression read as: <em>Please don’t say this in exactly these words,
ever again, to anyone who signs my paycheck.</em></p>
<p>At the time, I was confused. I thought I was reassuring her: “I
understand your constraints. I can optimize for what you actually need.”
What she reasonably heard was closer to: “I have reverse-engineered the
social game you are embedded in and I am now explicitly min-maxing your
boss’s feelings about me.”</p>
<p>In retrospect, that was my first clear encounter with a meta-rule of
corporate life:</p>
<p><strong>You are allowed to play the game.</strong><br />
<strong>You are not supposed to write down the rules.</strong></p>
<p>The organization must persist a story about “merit” and “impact” that
is neutral, objective, and morally acceptable. Writing it as a
status-weighted sum of feelings about you is not morally acceptable,
even if it’s descriptively accurate.</p>
<h2 id="habitus-why-it-was-easy-for-her-and-hard-for-me">7. Habitus: Why
It Was Easy for Her and Hard for Me</h2>
<p>In hindsight, my manager was doing something I didn’t have language
for yet.</p>
<p>She was a <strong>natural affective-labor manager</strong>. She spoke
fluent HR doxa. She could feel, without effort, which stories would land
in a VP’s office and which wouldn’t. She had an internal gyroscope that
told her what kinds of updates, phrased in what kinds of ways, would
count as “real impact” versus “nice-to-have tinkering.”</p>
<p>A sociologist would say she had the right <strong>habitus</strong>
for that field: the internalized feel for how things are done, what
counts as real, what counts as “impactful” versus merely interesting.
The norms of that space lived in her body. Maybe it was natural. Maybe
honed from years of practice. (See <a
href="#pierre-bourdieu">Bourdieu</a>)</p>
<p>I had the opposite profile. I could build the tool and explain the
design, but I had almost no feel for that emotional-political terrain.
She <strong>intuitively</strong> tracked who mattered, what they cared
about, and which narratives they were hungry for. I had to
<strong>derive</strong> all of that on paper, after getting smacked by
reality.</p>
<p>Some people are born into—or trained into—the right habitus for a
given field. They just “get” what counts, who matters, what to say in
which room. The rest of us end up reverse-engineering it after enough
humiliations.</p>
<p>KarmaRank is basically my adaptation for that asymmetry: a way for
people like me—who don’t come pre-installed with the right habitus—to
see the game board clearly enough that we don’t have to learn it all the
hard way.</p>
<h2 id="from-net-karma-to-karmarank">8. From Net Karma to KarmaRank</h2>
<p>The leap from Net Karma to KarmaRank comes from realizing that
everyone is playing the same game. That is, the formula is
<strong>transitive</strong>.</p>
<p>The people with high Status to you are themselves embedded in their
own <strong>field</strong>, trying to secure karma from others who have
high Status to them. People trade various forms of
<strong>capital</strong>—social clout, headcount, literal budget,
corporate rank, etc.—in order to improve their positions. Combine the
individual perspective with Google’s PageRank algorithm (iteratively
re-scoring pages in the hyperlink graph) and you arrive at
KarmaRank.</p>
<p>Everyone has the same job: to secure <strong>Status-Weighted
Stories</strong> in a <strong>dynamic, heterogenous field</strong>, and
call this narrative aggregation “impact.”</p>
<p>Some people intuit this. Good for them. The rest of us have to write
it down.</p>
<p>KarmaRank is for the second group. You don’t have to struggle through
a decade of half-failed projects and flushed 1:1s to see KarmaRank. I
did that part for you.</p>
<h1
id="security-advisory-five-vulnerabilities-in-the-default-engineering-worldview">SECURITY
ADVISORY: Five Vulnerabilities in the Default Engineering Worldview</h1>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Active Exploitation Detected</p>
<p>This manuscript is going to systematically dismantle a number of your
unexamined, cherished beliefs. I have too much respect for your time to
withhold that knowledge, and so here it is, up front.</p>
<p>The reason you are frustrated—the reason you feel gaslit by HR,
confused by promotions, and exhausted by “politics”—is not that you are
bad at your job, or that the system is “rigged”. It is because you have
been systematically indoctrinated (optimized) into a vulnerable mental
model.</p>
<p>What follows is a list of the <strong>Five Critical
Vulnerabilities</strong> in the Default Engineering Worldview (DEW).</p>
<h3 id="cve-dew-01-the-puritan-work-ethic">CVE-DEW-01: The Puritan Work
Ethic</h3>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> You believe that hard work is
intrinsically virtuous and that “grinding” is the path to success.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> In engineering, we value efficiency,
not brute force. Yet in your career, you are manually brute-forcing your
way through tasks, hoping someone notices your sweat.</p>
<p>The firm does not value your suffering. It values
<strong>Status-Weighted Stories</strong>. If you work 60 hours to do
what a politically savvy peer achieves in 6 hours of “visibility work,”
you aren’t a hero. You are inefficient. The system interprets your
silence and suffering as low-value labor.</p>
<h3
id="cve-dew-02-the-rendering-error-noumenal-vs.-phenomenal">CVE-DEW-02:
The Rendering Error (Noumenal vs. Phenomenal)</h3>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> You believe your work (the code,
the analysis, the doc) is the “Real Object”—what philosophers call
<strong>noumenal</strong>, the thing in itself—and your manager’s
opinion is just a noisy approximation of that truth.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> You have it backward. In the corporate
epistemology, <strong>perception is reality</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no capital-T Truth behind the rating; the rating <em>is</em>
the object. Your code, docs, and analysis only matter insofar as they
shift someone’s perception enough to move your score. Do not confuse the
input (your labor) with the output (the recognition). <em>The rating is
the job.</em></p>
<h3 id="cve-dew-03-the-protocol-mismatch-the-moral-matrix">CVE-DEW-03:
The Protocol Mismatch (The Moral Matrix)</h3>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> You assume your manager and
leadership are driven by “Logic” and “Accuracy.” When they make an
illogical decision, you assume they are underinformed, stupid, or
technically illiterate.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> They are not stupid. They are
optimizing for a different set of moral foundations.</p>
<p>While you are optimizing for <strong>Truth</strong> and
<strong>Efficiency</strong>, they are often optimizing for
<strong>Loyalty</strong>, <strong>Authority</strong>, or
<strong>Sanctity</strong>. You are sending JSON to a SOAP endpoint. The
communication is failing not because the data is wrong, but because the
format is rejected.</p>
<h3 id="cve-dew-04-the-scoreboard-glitch-meritocracy">CVE-DEW-04: The
Scoreboard Glitch (Meritocracy)</h3>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> You believe “Merit” is universal.
Our measurements may be noisy, but an ideal exists.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> “Merit” is a <strong>dynamically typed
variable</strong>. Its definition is assigned at runtime by whoever
holds power.</p>
<p>A criterion may be objective (e.g., “lines of code,” “revenue
generated”), but the <em>selection</em> and <em>weighting</em> of
criteria are matters of taste and political convenience. There is no
Golden Age to return to. The scorecard is ineradicably biased because
the people keeping score are also playing the game.</p>
<h3
id="cve-dew-05-the-documentation-void-strategic-ambiguity">CVE-DEW-05:
The Documentation Void (Strategic Ambiguity)</h3>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> You keep waiting for HR or
Leadership to publish clear, consistent rules for promotion and
compensation. You think the ambiguity is a mistake or a sign of
incompetence.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> The ambiguity is a <strong>primary
security feature</strong>.</p>
<p>If the firm gave you a clear, static set of rules (e.g., “Do X, Y,
and Z to get promoted”), you, and everyone else, would ruthlessly
optimize for those variables and destroy the company (<a
href="#goodharts-law">Goodhart’s Law</a>). Leadership <em>must</em>
deploy “Strategic Ambiguity” to retain their veto power. They will never
give you the manual you are looking for. You have to reverse-engineer
it.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you can accept these five premises—or at least entertain them as a
working hypothesis—we can proceed. The rest of this text depends on
patching these specific vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We are going to take your career off the “Default” setting and switch
it to “Manual.” Whether you use these tools to claw your way to the
C-suite or just to minimize your effort while maximizing your karmic
ROI, the mechanics are the same.</p>
<p>Let’s open the debugger.</p>
<h1 id="law-1-separation-of-private-firm-ledgers">Law #1: Separation of
Private &amp; Firm Ledgers</h1>
<p>You are running two ledgers in one head.</p>
<p>In your <strong>Private Ledger</strong> you keep score in terms of
craft and ethics. “Did I build the right thing?” “Is it correct,
elegant, fair?” It’s your local religion. You don’t need anyone’s
permission to maintain it. Taste is pre-rational.</p>
<p>On the other ledger, the <strong>Firm Ledger</strong>, the firm keeps
score in terms of stories that travel. “Who says you helped them?” “How
easy is it to repeat that story up the chain?” Its unit of account is
the <strong>Status-Weighted Story</strong> about you, passed between
people who can move budget, headcount, and promotion packets.</p>
<p>It is a common yet critical mistake to assume these ledgers are the
same system with some measurement noise. They’re not. They are different
databases with different schemas, occasionally synced only by accident.
Like a hash collision.</p>
<p>When you stay late refactoring code nobody will ever hear about,
that’s a Private Ledger credit. When a director tells a VP “she saved
our launch,” that’s a Firm Ledger credit. These events often do not
coincide in time, or at all.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/two-ledgers.png"
alt="Private Ledger vs. Firm Ledger" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Private Ledger vs. Firm
Ledger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the firm’s point of view, your Private Ledger is an internal
hobby (on company time!). They don’t query it. They query the Firm
Ledger, then serialize the result into ratings, levels, and comp.</p>
<p>Whether you treat the Firm Ledger as morally authoritative is your
business. This text only cares that you stop expecting Private Ledger
entries to auto-replicate into a system that never subscribed to that
table.</p>
<h1 id="law-2-the-rating-is-the-job">Law #2: The Rating Is The Job</h1>
<p>The firm does not pay you by the hour. And it certainly does not pay
you “for the work.”</p>
<p>The firm pays you an annualized total comp package, dripped out in
biweekly installments, <strong>for a portfolio of Status-Weighted
Stories about you</strong> that your evaluators are willing to
endorse.</p>
<p>From the firm’s perspective, any effort that does not improve that
portfolio is tantamount to <strong>willful embezzlement</strong>. You
are quietly cashing their checks while investing your energy into a
private ledger they neither see nor value.</p>
<p>Whether you internalize this moral framing as your own is your
business. I’m not saying you <em>should</em> treat your craft or your
users as secondary.</p>
<p>I’m saying: <strong>this is how the firm’s operating system sees
you</strong>, as demonstrably encoded in their performance appraisal
rituals. When you understand that, a lot of confusing decisions suddenly
make sense.</p>
<h1 id="law-3-impact-who-cares">Law #3: Impact = Who Cares?</h1>
<p>“Impact” is a fluff word.</p>
<p>People say “impact” the way astrologers say “energy”: a vague scalar
that is always supposed to be “higher” than last year. It sounds
serious. It explains nothing.</p>
<p>Under KarmaRank, “impact” has a very specific implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Impact = Who cares?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally: who <span class="math inline">\((S_i)\)</span> cares <span
class="math inline">\((k_i)\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Who” = which people in the field have non-zero Status with respect
to your rating.</li>
<li>“Cares” = how much emotional and political value they get from
telling a story where you are the hero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Written as math, your <strong>Net Impact</strong> to the firm is just
your Net Status-Weighted Karma:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K = \sum_i S_i \cdot k_i
\]</span></p>
<p>If nobody with Status cares, the system has nowhere to store your
so-called impact. It lives only on your Private Ledger as a pleasant
feeling about yourself.</p>
<p>This gives you a simple test:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I improved test coverage” → Who cares?</li>
<li>“I made the UI nicer” → Who cares?</li>
<li>“I cut cold-start time by 40% for Team X’s workflow” → Who, by name,
is going to care enough to say that out loud in a calibration room?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot answer “who cares?” (with names, not archetypes), you
are doing <strong>speculative impact</strong>. To you, it may be good.
It may be virtuous. It may even be useful in some cosmic hard-to-measure
sense. But as far as the Firm Ledger is concerned, it does not exist
yet.</p>
<p>Law #3 is the operational version of Law #2.<br />
“The rating is the job” tells you what gets serialized.<br />
“Impact = Who Cares?” tells you how to decide where to spend your next
hour.</p>
<h1 id="meta-law-you-do-not-talk-about-karmarank">Meta-Law: You Do Not
Talk About KarmaRank</h1>
<p>You are allowed to play the game.<br />
You are not supposed to describe the game.</p>
<p>When I showed my manager the Net Status-Weighted Karma formula, she
wasn’t upset because the math was wrong. It was disempowering to see
years of political savvy and emotional labor collapsed into a cold
one-liner.</p>
<p>The modern firm is a social network made of <em>people</em> who, like
you, have their own pre-rational tastes, preferences and sacred cows.
But unlike you, most people are unwilling to decouple their private
ledger from the firm’s—to see things clearly.</p>
<p>The modern firm needs to maintain a public religion of “merit,”
“impact,” and “values.” People have to be able to say, with a straight
face, that performance ratings emerge from neutral evaluation of
objective contributions. If you insist on talking about Status weights
and emotional payoff of stories, you are not “insightful.” You are
indecent.</p>
<p>From the inside, the rule looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You may act on the true objective function.<br />
You may not name the true objective function.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are expected to translate your moves back into the house liturgy:
“driving business outcomes,” “raising the quality bar,” “delighting
users,” “living the leadership principles.” The closer your internal
model gets to “I am maximizing high-Status storytellers who enjoy
endorsing me,” the more aggressively you must wrap it in acceptable
language.</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy. It is a hygiene mechanism. If the firm
acknowledged, openly, that your rating is a status-weighted sum of other
people’s feelings about you, half the building would quit and the rest
would start playing even more nakedly political games. Strategic
ambiguity keeps the story barely stable.</p>
<p>So you keep two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your head, you run KarmaRank. You think in terms of fields,
Status weights, stories in flight.</li>
<li>Out loud, you speak HR doxa. You think in terms of impact,
customers, team success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violating Law #3 does not change how the system works. It only
changes how the system categorizes you. Instead of “high-potential,” you
become “cynical,” “political,” or “not a culture fit.”</p>
<p>This text is written in the forbidden dialect on purpose. Treat it
like you would any other internal tool: useful in the debugger, suicidal
in the release build.</p>
<h1 id="the-calibration-cylinder-topology-of-the-trial">The Calibration
Cylinder: Topology of the Trial</h1>
<p>According to Law #2, the rating is the job. And by our earlier
observations, the unit of account is the <strong>Status-Weighted
Story</strong>. That’s all well and good, but whose karma are we
harvesting here?</p>
<p>In this chapter you’ll learn the local topology of the network graph
as it applies to you: a structure I call the calibration cylinder.</p>
<h2 id="the-calibration-cylinder">1. The Calibration Cylinder</h2>
<p>If I asked you to draw a map of your workplace, you would likely draw
a Tree: the Org Chart. You are a leaf node, connected to a branch
(Manager), connected to a trunk (Director/VP), and so on.</p>
<p>Delete that mental image. It is a static representation of reporting
lines, useful primarily for knowing whose name is on your vacation
approval. It tells you little about the physics of how your value is
actually calculated.</p>
<p>The Org Chart implies a chain of command. The reality as it applies
to you is a pressure vessel.</p>
<p>You are at the center of a circle. The perimeter of that circle
consists of your <strong>Peers</strong> reporting to your shared
manager.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/peer-circle.png" alt="Circle of You and your Peers" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Circle of You and your Peers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Your Manager is at the center of their own circle, surrounded by
their <strong>Peer Managers</strong>. The Skip-Level (manager’s manager)
sits above, the center of their own circle of peers, looking down into
the cylinder.</p>
<p>So to summarize: three levels. You at the bottom, your manager in the
middle, your skip at the top. You three form the vertical core; your
respective peers form the rings around each level.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/calibration-cylinder.png" alt="Calibration Cylinder" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Calibration Cylinder</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This cylindrical portion of the corporate social graph contains the
people who have direct influence on your rating. People exterior to the
cylinder may have indirect influence, subject to the discretion of the
in-cylinder participants. For example, if you’re a manager, then the
feedback of your circle of reports below you may influence your manager
above.</p>
<p>Twice a year (or however often your company performs reviews), the
lid is put on this cylinder, and the heat is turned up. This is the
<strong>Calibration Meeting</strong>. And it works a whole lot like a
courtroom.</p>
<h2 id="the-courtroom-dynamic">2. The Courtroom Dynamic</h2>
<p>You probably know this critical fact about your performance review:
<strong>You are not in the room.</strong></p>
<p>Your evaluation is not a standardized test where you fill in the
bubbles and a machine grades you. It is a <strong>litigation</strong>.
It is a trial by jury, held in absentia.</p>
<p>Once you understand that the Calibration Meeting is a courtroom, the
roles become clear.</p>
<h3 id="the-defendant-you">The Defendant: You</h3>
<p>You are on trial. Your compensation, your title, and your future
leverage are on the docket. But because you are not allowed in the room,
you cannot speak for yourself.</p>
<h3 id="the-defense-attorney-your-manager">The Defense Attorney: Your
Manager</h3>
<p>This is the most important reframe in your career. Your manager is
not your “boss” during calibration; they are your court-appointed
counsel.</p>
<p>Most engineers treat 1:1s as “status updates” or “confessionals.”
This is a strategic error. A 1:1 is <strong>legal
discovery</strong>.</p>
<p>If you walk into a 1:1 and say, “I’m struggling with this API,” you
are handing your attorney bad facts.</p>
<p>If you walk in and say, “I just shipped X, which solved Y for Team
Z,” you are handing them <strong>Exhibits A, B, and C</strong>.</p>
<p>Your attorney (Manager) is likely tired, overworked, and managing 6
other cases. If you do not hand them the prepared brief—the
status-weighted stories—they will not have the energy to invent a
defense for you. They will plea bargain you down to “Meets Expectations”
to save their political capital for a client who gave them better
evidence.</p>
<h3 id="the-prosecution-jury-your-managers-peers">The Prosecution /
Jury: Your Manager’s Peers</h3>
<p>Here is where the “Team Player” myth dies.</p>
<p>The other managers in the room are not your friends. They are your
Manager’s Peers (<span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> nodes in the
Cylinder).</p>
<p>They are acting as both <strong>Jury</strong> and
<strong>Prosecution</strong>.</p>
<p>Why prosecution? Because the budget is finite. The “Exceeds
Expectations” rating is a scarce resource (often capped at 10-20% of the
pool).</p>
<p>For Manager A to get a promotion for <em>their</em> star engineer,
they effectively need to argue that <em>you</em> do not deserve one. It
is a zero-sum game of horse-trading.</p>
<h3 id="the-judge-the-skip-level-directorvp">The Judge: The Skip-Level
(Director/VP)</h3>
<p>The Judge sits at the head of the table. They often don’t know your
name, or if they do, they know it as a variable in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>They care about three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Process Integrity:</strong> Does this look fair enough to
avoid a lawsuit?</li>
<li><strong>Budget Compliance:</strong> Are we distributing the limited
pile of money according to the curve?</li>
<li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Can we get this meeting over with?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-witness-stand">3. The Witness Stand</h2>
<p>In the KarmaRank chapter, we discussed Status-Weighted Stories (<span
class="math inline">\(K = \sum S_i \cdot k_i\)</span>). Here is why the
variable <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> (Status) is the
dominant term.</p>
<p>When your Manager (Attorney) presents your case, they will point to
your work. “My report refactored the legacy billing system.”</p>
<p>If the room is silent, that claim dies. It is just a claim.</p>
<p>But if a Peer Manager (a Juror) speaks up and says: “Yes, and that
refactor saved my team 20 hours a week,” the dynamic shifts
instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Documents do not testify.</strong> A Jira ticket cannot take
the stand. A pull request cannot look the jury in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>People testify.</strong></p>
<p>When you help a high-Status person in the organization, you are not
just “being helpful.” You are <strong>securing a witness</strong>. You
are ensuring that arguments are made, you have friends in the jury
box.</p>
<p>This is why “visibility” matters. Visibility is simply the
availability of credible witnesses during your trial.</p>
<h2 id="jury-tampering-as-a-service">4. Jury Tampering as a Service</h2>
<p>If you treat your job as “writing code,” you are leaving your fate to
the rhetorical skills of your tired Manager.</p>
<p>If you treat your job as “generating Status-Weighted Stories,” you
are effectively engaging in <strong>lawful jury tampering</strong>.</p>
<p>Your goal is to ensure that by the time the Calibration Meeting
starts, the verdict is already technically decided because three of the
five high-<span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> people in the room
have already “bought” your story.</p>
<h2 id="transitivity">5. Transitivity</h2>
<p>Crucially, your manager is playing the same game. They’re at the
bottom-center of their Calibration Cylinder. Their own rating will be
determined by the next layer up. Their own peers’ feedback funnels to
their manager (your skip) whose peers are your manager’s jury.</p>
<p>Why does this matter to you? Your manager is cultivating their own
Status-Weighted Stories (exhibits) for their own upcoming defense. How
they “manage” you is crucial evidence made in direct view of their
attorney and peers.</p>
<p>And so, your manager’s eagerness to defend your case will naturally
be influenced by the degree to which that defense contributes to their
own portfolio. Thus, it’s prudent to proactively consider your manager’s
Calibration Cylinder in crafting your own stories.</p>
<h2 id="turtles-all-the-way-up">6. Turtles All The Way Up</h2>
<p>You might think, “This sounds exhausting. I’ll just become a
Manager/Director/CEO and stop playing games.”</p>
<p>I have bad news. The topology is fractal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You</strong> generate stories for your Manager to survive
the Team Calibration.</li>
<li><strong>Your Manager</strong> generates stories for the Director to
survive the Org Calibration.</li>
<li><strong>The Director</strong> generates stories for the VP.</li>
<li><strong>The CEO</strong> generates stories for the Board /
Market.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the CEO announces a layoff, or a pivot to AI, or a stock
buyback, do not mistake it for “strategy” in the pure sense. It is a
<strong>Status-Weighted Story</strong> presented to the Board of
Directors (The Jury) and the Market (The Judge) to prove that the CEO is
still a “High Performer.”</p>
<p>The cylinder goes up forever. The only thing that changes is the
blast radius of the decisions.</p>
<h1 id="tactics-i-karma-driven-development-kdd">Tactics I: Karma-Driven
Development (KDD)</h1>
<p>In software engineering, the most disciplined teams practice
<strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>. The rule is simple:
<strong>Red, Green, Refactor.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Red:</strong> Write a test that fails (because the feature
doesn’t exist yet).</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Write just enough code to make the test
pass.</li>
<li><strong>Refactor:</strong> Clean up the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most careers, however, run on <strong>Waterfall</strong>. You do
months of work, ship it, and then hope that HR writes a test that you
happen to pass. This is madness. You are building features without a
spec.</p>
<p>To fix this, we will adopt <strong>Karma-Driven Development
(KDD)</strong>. In this framework, you never write a line of code until
you have written the performance review bullet point that rewards it.
Remember Law #2, the rating is the job.</p>
<h2 id="phase-1-backlog-grooming-political-echolocation">Phase 1:
Backlog Grooming (Political Echolocation)</h2>
<p>Before you can write a test, you need requirements.</p>
<p>Right now, your mental backlog is likely full of “Technical Debt” and
“Cool Ideas.” You might be tempted to pick the one that looks most
intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p>Stop. You cannot sort this list by <strong>Technical Merit</strong>
(Private Ledger). You must sort it by <strong>Market Demand</strong>
(Firm Ledger).</p>
<p>To do this, you must leave your IDE and perform <strong>Political
Echolocation</strong>. You need to ping the network to see what returns
a signal.</p>
<h3 id="the-hard-problem-heuristic">The “Hard Problem” Heuristic</h3>
<p>Schedule a 15-minute sync with a High-Status Node (<span
class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>)—a Staff Engineer, a Principal PM, or
your Skip-Level Manager.</p>
<p>Do not ask: <em>“What should I work on?”</em> That makes you look
like a junior execution-bot.</p>
<p>Instead, ask for their <strong>mental model</strong> (a “calibrated
question” in <a href="#chris-voss">Voss’s</a> terms):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m looking at our Q3 technical roadmap, and I know you’ve been
thinking a lot about [Strategic Theme X]. How does [Project Y] fit into
your mental model of that problem?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This accomplishes three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Ben Franklin Effect:</strong> Benjamin Franklin
famously observed that he who has done you a kindness will be more ready
to do you another. By asking for their “wisdom,” you make them feel like
a visionary. They invest in you. They now have a subconscious stake in
your success because you are a vessel for their ideas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signal Detection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they look bored or give a generic answer: <strong>Low <span
class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> (Caring).</strong> Delete the
ticket.</li>
<li>If they lean in, start drawing on the whiteboard, or vent about a
specific pain point: <strong>High <span
class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span>.</strong> Move this to the top of the
backlog.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cache Warming (The Mere Exposure Effect):</strong> In the
Calibration Courtroom, when your name comes up, you do not want the Jury
to do a cold lookup.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cold Lookup:</em> “Who? Oh, the backend dev? Okay.”</li>
<li><em>Warm Cache:</em> “Oh, right. Smart dev. We chatted about the API
strategy last month. They Get It™.” By grooming the backlog with them,
you are pre-loading your identity into their L1 Cache.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-2-write-the-test-the-spec">Phase 2: Write The Test (The
Spec)</h2>
<p>Now that you have validated the demand, you enter the <strong>Red
State</strong>.</p>
<p>Open a blank document. Write the bullet point exactly as you want it
to appear in your promotion packet six months from now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Test:</strong> “Reduced AWS infrastructure spend by 20%
($150k/annually) by optimizing hot-path caching patterns, effectively
extending our runway by 2 weeks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, this test fails. The cost of telling it is high because
the story is false. But you now have a target.</p>
<h2 id="phase-3-the-compiler-check">Phase 3: The Compiler Check</h2>
<p>Do not start coding yet.</p>
<p>Take this specific bullet point (The Test) to your Manager (The
Attorney).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I’m thinking of targeting a 20% reduction in
cloud spend this quarter. Is that a story that moves the needle for us
in the calibration room?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a compiler check.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compiler Error:</strong> <em>“The Director doesn’t care
about cost right now; she cares about user growth.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The test is invalid. <strong>Delete the
test.</strong> You just saved yourself three weeks of invisible
labor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Compiler Success:</strong> <em>“Oh, absolutely. The VP is
screaming about burn rate.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The test is valid. You have a
contract.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phase-4-green-state-implementation">Phase 4: Green State
(Implementation)</h2>
<p>Now—and only now—do you do the work.</p>
<p>And crucially, <strong>you do only the work required to pass the
test.</strong></p>
<p>Your goal is to turn the test from Red to Green with the minimum
possible calorie expenditure.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can hit the 20% reduction by changing a config file:
<strong>Do that.</strong></li>
<li>If you can hit it by deleting unused tables: <strong>Do
that.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The “Puritan” inside you will want to rewrite the entire caching
layer to be “elegant.”</p>
<p><strong>Suppress the Puritan.</strong></p>
<p>The Firm did not buy “Elegance.” They bought “20% Cost Reduction.”
Any effort spent beyond the Green State is <strong>Gold
Plating</strong>—uncompensated labor that introduces risk without adding
status.</p>
<h2 id="phase-5-refactoring-the-brief">Phase 5: Refactoring (The
Brief)</h2>
<p>The work is done. The test passes. Now you engage in
“Refactoring”—but not of the code. You refactor the
<strong>Story</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where you format the reality for the courtroom. You take your
Green Test and you wrap it in the narrative structure we discussed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Villain:</strong> (We were burning cash).</li>
<li><strong>The Hero:</strong> (I stopped the bleeding).</li>
<li><strong>The Witness:</strong> (The Skip-Level who helped you groom

<li><strong>The Visual:</strong> (The chart showing the cliff).</li>
</ol>
<p>We will dive into how to structure the brief in the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="summary-the-inversion">Summary: The Inversion</h2>
<p>The naive engineer builds the software, then tries to write a

<p>The KDD practitioner writes the brochure, pre-sells it to the market,
and then manufactures the product to spec.</p>
<p>Code is a liability. The Status-Weighted Story is the asset. Never
generate the liability without securing the asset first.</p>
<h1 id="tactics-ii-manufacturing-evidence-the-brief">Tactics II:
Manufacturing Evidence (The Brief)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, you learned Karma Driven Development (KDD),
a strategy for choosing Status-Weighted Stories <em>first</em> and
working backwards to make them true. Now it’s time to learn how to
optimize that evidence for your manager to bring to calibration
court.</p>
<p>Your manager is tired. They have six other cases to litigate. They do
not remember that cool bug fix you did in March.</p>
<p>In the lead up to your performance review, if you ask your manager to
“look at my commits,” you are asking your lawyer to investigate the
crime scene ten minutes before the trial starts. You will lose.</p>
<p>Your job is to hand them a fully formed <strong>Legal Brief</strong>.
This is a document that requires zero cognitive load to copy-paste into
the HR portal.</p>
<p>But how do you write a brief that survives the adversarial
environment of the Calibration Cylinder? You have to understand the
psychology of the jury.</p>
<h2 id="feeding-the-numerophiles">1. Feeding the Numerophiles</h2>
<p>Your evaluators (Directors, VPs, Senior Peers) are human beings, but
they are a specific subspecies. They are
<strong>Numerophiles</strong>.</p>
<p>They are obsessed with quantification. In the absence of trust, they
use numbers as a proxy for truth. A paragraph of prose feels like an
“opinion.” A bar chart feels like “science.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> “I significantly improved the performance of
the login page.” (Hearsay).</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> “Reduced P99 login latency by <strong>230ms
(-14%)</strong>, reclaiming <strong>45 engineering-hours</strong> per
month in wait time.” (Fact).</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not matter that the “45 hours” is a back-of-the-napkin
estimate based on shaky assumptions. It is a <strong>Number</strong>. It
has significant digits. It triggers the “Truth” receptor in the
evaluator’s brain.</p>
<h2 id="moral-targeting-know-your-judge">2. Moral Targeting (Know Your
Judge)</h2>
<p>Before you pick your number, you must pick your narrative. This goes
back to <strong>CVE-DEW-03 (The Protocol Mismatch)</strong>. You must
frame your achievement in a way that strokes the specific <strong><a
href="#jonathan-haidt">Moral Matrix</a></strong> of your evaluators.</p>
<p>Different tribes worship different gods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sales/Exec Tribe:</strong> Worships
<strong>Authority</strong> and <strong>Revenue</strong>. They care about
speed, dollars, and “winning.”</li>
<li><strong>The Old Guard/Sysadmin Tribe:</strong> Worships
<strong>Sanctity</strong> and <strong>Order</strong>. They care about
stability, uptime, and “doing it the right way.”</li>
<li><strong>The Modern SV/HR Tribe:</strong> Worships
<strong>Care/Harm</strong> and <strong>Fairness</strong>. They care
about “User Delight,” “Inclusivity,” and “Democratizing Access.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You must estimate the moral composition of your org in general and
the Calibration Room in particular, then tailor your evidence
accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-study-the-ui-refresh">The Case Study: The UI
Refresh</h3>
<p>Let’s say you updated a settings page.</p>
<p><strong>If the Jury is Sales-Driven:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative:</strong> “Removed friction from the conversion
funnel.”</li>
<li><strong>The Metric:</strong> “Conversion rate increased by 0.5%.
Annualized revenue impact: $50k.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the Jury is Engineering-Driven:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative:</strong> “Paid down technical debt by migrating
to the new design system.”</li>
<li><strong>The Metric:</strong> “Deleted 4,000 lines of legacy CSS.
Reduced build size by 12KB.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the Jury is Modern SV (Care/Harm):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative:</strong> “Reduced cognitive load for frustrated
users.”</li>
<li><strong>The Metric:</strong> “Using Likert scales to assess
convenience pre- and post-launch, we found the new UI scored
<strong>~1.53 points higher</strong> than baseline (n=20).”</li>
</ul>
<p>Same work. Different story. Different numbers.</p>
<p>If you pitch the “CSS deletion” story to a room full of “User
Empathy” managers, you get a pat on the head. If you show them the
Likert scale data, you get a promotion.</p>
<h2 id="the-visual-kill-shot">3. The Visual Kill Shot</h2>
<p>Humans are visual creatures. A wall of text is a barrier; an image is
a bypass tunnel straight to the brain.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, <strong>do not just state the number. Show the
delta.</strong></p>
<p>If you are claiming that your new UI is better, do not just write
“1.53 points higher.” Paste a side-by-side histogram.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left:</strong> A red, messy distribution (The Old Way).</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> A green, tight distribution shifted to the
right (The New Way).</li>
</ul>
<p>When a tired Director scans your packet at 4:00 PM on a Friday, they
will not read your bullet points. They <em>will</em> look at the pretty
picture. The picture says “Up and to the Right.” The picture says
“Competence.”</p>

<h2 id="constructing-the-brief">4. Constructing the Brief</h2>
<p>Your final deliverable to your manager—the document you hand them two
weeks before calibration—should look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> [The Moral Frame] e.g., “Democratizing
Data Access for Non-Technical Users”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Context (The Villain):</strong> “Previously, 40% of PM
queries required Engineer intervention, causing delay and frustration
(Harm).”</li>
<li><strong>The Action (The Hero):</strong> “Built a self-serve
dashboard using Metabase.”</li>
<li><strong>The Result (The Evidence):</strong>
<ul>
<li>“Reduced Engineer-assist tickets by <strong>85%</strong>.”</li>
<li>“Saved <strong>20 hours/week</strong> of engineering time.”</li>
<li><em>Insert Screenshot of Ticket Volume dropping off a
cliff.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Witness:</strong> “As [Director Alice] noted, this
‘fundamentally changed how we make decisions’.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-this-lying">5. Is This Lying?</h2>
<p>You might feel a twinge of guilt. “I didn’t actually measure the 20
hours saved, I just estimated it.” “The Likert scale sample size was
only 12 people.”</p>
<p>Relax. You are not falsifying data. You are <strong>formatting
reality</strong>.</p>
<p>The firm demands a number to justify the budget. If you refuse to
provide one because you are waiting for “perfect, academically rigorous
data,” you are not being noble. You are being invisible.</p>
<p>You are estimating. You are deriving. You are translating your labor
into the native language of the colony: <strong>Numerology</strong>.</p>
<p>Give them the number so they can give you the money.</p>
<h1 id="the-exit-the-market-check">The Exit: The Market Check</h1>
<p>We have spent this entire text discussing how to optimize your
position inside the firm. We covered how to debug the culture, how to
identify what matters, and how to manufacture the evidence required to
get rewarded.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the math just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Maybe your manager is fundamentally disempowered. Maybe your division
is a cost center facing budget cuts. Maybe the firm itself is
sinking.</p>
<p>In these cases, applying Karma-Driven Development is like trying to
grow crops in salted earth. You are doing the farming right, but the
environment is too hostile to yield a harvest.</p>
<p>When you find yourself in this position, engineers often try to “work
harder” to fix it. They try to debug the department. They try to save
the team.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. You cannot fix a system you do not own.</p>
<p>When the environment can no longer support your growth, the rational
move isn’t to complain, or to grind harder. It is to take your talents
to a market that values them.</p>
<h2 id="the-loyalty-discount">1. The Loyalty Discount</h2>
<p>There is a structural reality in the modern corporation that you must
accept: <strong>Budgets are optimized for Acquisition, not
Retention.</strong></p>
<p>It’s nothing personal. It’s just how the money is pot-bound.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Hires</strong> are paid from the “Hiring Budget,” which
is pegged to the current, competitive market rate.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Employees</strong> are paid from the “Retention
Budget,” which is usually pegged to your entry price plus a standard
3-4% annual adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a high-demand industry, these two numbers drift apart rapidly. If
you stay at a company for more than two years, you are likely suffering
from a <strong>Loyalty Discount</strong>.</p>
<p>You are effectively subsidizing the firm to hire your replacement,
who will sit at the desk next to you, do less work, and make 20% more
than you. The firm counts on your inertia. They are betting that the
pain of interviewing is greater than the pain of being underpaid.</p>
<p>It pays to prove them wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the-market-check">2. The Market Check</h2>
<p>How do you know when it’s time to go? You don’t rely on “bad vibes”
or a single bad day. You treat it like data.</p>
<p>Every six to twelve months, you should perform a <strong>Market
Check</strong>.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you are quitting. It means you are performing
<strong>Price Discovery</strong>. You cannot know the value of your
employment by looking at your current pay stub. You can only know it by
seeing what a stranger is willing to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can’t get an offer that beats your current package:
<strong>You are priced correctly.</strong> (Or your skills have
stagnated).</li>
<li>If you get an offer for 30% more: <strong>The firm is arbitraging
you.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the truth is just data. Ignoring the market is
negligence.</p>
<h2 id="the-clean-slate">3. The Clean Slate</h2>
<p>The strongest argument for leaving isn’t always money. It’s
<strong>Reputation Hygiene</strong>.</p>
<p>Inside your current company, you carry the weight of negative valence
Status-Weighted Stories ascribed to you (deserved or not). The awkward
interaction with that Product Manager? It’s still in the air. Your
“file” contains legacy baggage.</p>
<p>When you interview at a new company, you get a <strong>Clean
Slate</strong>.</p>
<p>The hiring manager doesn’t know about all your past stories. They
don’t know your current boss thinks you’re “just a mid-level engineer.”
They only know what you tell them. You get to define your identity from
scratch.</p>
<h2 id="your-brief-is-your-resume">4. Your Brief is Your Resume</h2>
<p>This is where the work we’ve done in previous chapters pays its final
dividend.</p>
<p>You might worry that leaving means “wasting” the effort you put into
building your internal case.</p>
<p>The opposite is true.</p>
<p>The Status-Weighted Stories you manufactured for your internal promo
packet?</p>
<p>The <strong>Briefs</strong> you wrote with the “Villain, Hero,
Witness” structure?</p>
<p><strong>That is your interview script.</strong></p>
<p>The exact same artifacts you built to survive the internal
calibration are the ones you use to ace the external interview.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internally:</strong> You wrote the Brief to save your
manager time.</li>
<li><strong>Externally:</strong> You recite the Brief to show the hiring
committee you are a Senior Operator.</li>
</ul>
<p>“I reduced cloud spend by 20%” works everywhere. The story is never
wasted; it just changes audiences.</p>
<h2 id="arbitrage-as-a-strategy">5. Arbitrage as a Strategy</h2>
<p>We are taught to view job-hopping as a sign of instability or lack of
loyalty.</p>
<p>I encourage you to view it as <strong>Arbitrage</strong>.</p>
<p>If your Private Ledger says “I am a Senior Engineer,” but your Firm
Ledger says “You are a Level 3,” there is a mispricing in the market.
Arbitrage is simply the act of moving an asset from a market where it is
undervalued to a market where it is valued correctly.</p>
<p>You are not “giving up.” You are executing a trade.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The Corporate OS we’ve mapped in this text is a game. The Cylinder is
the board. Karma is the score.</p>
<p>But the board is not the world.</p>
<p>You have agency. You are the CEO of your own career. If the game
becomes unwinnable, or if the rewards stop matching the effort, do not
become toxic. Do not become cynical.</p>
<p>Just pack up your stories, take your clean slate, and go play
somewhere else.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-the-clear-pill">Conclusion: The Clear Pill</h1>
<p>This journey began with a cold dismantling of your worldview. It ends
with you getting your power back.</p>
<p>Throughout your life, you have been conditioned to be a
<strong>Convergent Thinker</strong>. In school, there was always a
correct answer in the back of the book. In code, there is a compiler
that tells you, definitively, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
You have a high need for cognition. You savor the clean, deterministic
satisfaction of a solved puzzle.</p>
<p>Because your value system has been so successful, it’s natural to
project it onto the world. It’s natural to assume that the corporation
<em>should</em> operate with the same logic and fairness as the systems
you build. When it doesn’t, you feel pain. You feel like the system is
broken.</p>
<p>I am here to tell you: <strong>The system is not broken.</strong> It
is just optimizing for a different variable.</p>
<h2 id="the-asymmetric-advantage">1. The Asymmetric Advantage</h2>
<p>You have likely viewed “Office Politics” as an impenetrable fog of
irrationality, inhabited by people who seem to succeed on “vibes” rather
than merit. You lack the <em>habitus</em>—the ingrained social reflex—to
navigate it naturally.</p>
<p>But here is the great news: <strong>The social network is just
another system.</strong></p>
<p>It is a complex, probabilistic state machine with inputs, outputs,
and weighting functions. It is messy, yes, but it is
<strong>legible</strong>. And you have a massive, asymmetric advantage
over the “pure politicians” you fear.</p>
<p><strong>A Systematizer can logic their way to Empathy.</strong>
<strong>But an Empath cannot feel their way to
Systematization.</strong></p>
<p>Think of it this way: You are like a CPU. You are optimized for
serial, logical, heavy-lift computation. To you, “politics” (rendering
the social graphics) feels slow and inefficient. But you <em>can</em> do
it. You can run the simulation. It might take more effort, but you can
execute the code.</p>
<p>The “Political Animals” in your org? They are like GPUs. They render
the social graphics instantly and effortlessly. But ask them to run the
logic? Ask them to build the complex architecture? They struggle.</p>
<p>Once you accept that social dynamics are learnable skills rather than
character flaws, you become a <strong>Full-Stack Human</strong>. You
become a creature that can build the value <em>and</em> sell the value.
There is no ceiling for that archetype.</p>
<h2 id="a-defense-of-the-court-mechanism">2. A Defense of the Court
Mechanism</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to treat calibration as a moral failure: “politics,”
“bias,” “vibes,” the triumph of charisma over truth. But if you model
the firm as an optimizer under constraints, calibration starts to look
less like corruption and more like a convergent solution to an ugly
valuation problem.</p>
<p>The firm isn’t trying to discover capital-T Truth. It’s trying to
allocate scarce rewards and scope in a way that is stable against
gaming, cheap enough to run, and socially legible.</p>
<p>Here is the constraint set that makes “just measure merit” a
fantasy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Unmeasurable Output:</strong> Much of the most important
work is not directly observable or comparable (architecture, incident
prevention, leverage, coordination, taste).</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneous Work:</strong> People do different kinds of
work on different timelines; outputs are not fungible units you can
grade like test scores.</li>
<li><strong>High Goodhart Pressure:</strong> Any published metric
becomes a target. Static rubrics get optimized into garbage (metric
farming) and destroy signal.</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial Incentives:</strong> The reward pool is capped.
Advocacy is zero-sum at the margin. Evaluators are not neutral graders;
they are competing representatives.</li>
<li><strong>Time Scarcity at the Top:</strong> Directors/VPs cannot
deeply inspect everyone’s work. The system must compress information
into legible artifacts (<a href="#james-c.-scott">Scott</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Legitimacy Requirements:</strong> The process must look
“fair enough” to remain stable (morale, retention) and defensible
(complaints, HR risk, lawsuits).</li>
<li><strong>Discretion Must Persist:</strong> Leadership must retain
veto power to handle edge cases, shifts in strategy, and the inherent
ambiguity of “value.”</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Compatibility:</strong> Decisions must be
explainable in the firm’s public religion (“impact,” “leadership,”
“values”) even when the real drivers are messier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given those constraints, fully objective, static, rule-based
promotion logic is not merely unavailable — it is actively dangerous. If
you did publish a clear scoring rubric, people would game it, the rubric
would stop measuring what you wanted, and the firm would drown in
locally-maximized trash. Strategic ambiguity is not an HR accident; it’s
an anti-Goodhart defense.</p>
<p>So what emerges instead is a valuation process that looks
suspiciously like <strong>common law</strong>: adversarial argument,
precedent, and testimony under bounded time. A peer group compares cases
because leadership cannot individually price everyone. A judge enforces
budgets and keeps the ritual moving. The process is messy, but it’s also
robust: it resists straightforward gaming better than naive metrics, and
it produces a story of legitimacy that the organization can live
with.</p>
<p>Calibration courts are plausibly a locally Pareto optimal (or at
least evolutionarily stable) mechanism given leadership’s constraints
and objectives. That is not a claim that the system is fair, kind,
unbiased, or truth-tracking. It’s a claim about mechanism design: you
can’t eliminate valuation; you can only decide where it lives and how it
fails.</p>
<p>Because this pattern is convergent, proposals to replace it inherit
the burden. If you want an alternative, show a Pareto improvement under
the same constraints, or explicitly name the trade you’re buying. Most
“objective metric” proposals just relocate discretion to whoever owns
the metric. The knife doesn’t disappear; it gets hidden in a
spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The practical takeaway is not “respect the Court.” The takeaway is:
stop pretending you’re in a lab. You’re in an adversarial valuation
proceeding.</p>
<p>Documents don’t testify. People testify.</p>
<p>If your work cannot survive cross-examination—if it has no credible
witnesses, no legible evidence, no story that travels—then as far as the
Court is concerned it is hearsay. Play the game you are in.</p>
<h2 id="the-palliative-lie">3. The Palliative Lie</h2>
<p>For years, the firm has fed you some combination of “Family” rhetoric
and “data-driven” mantras. They told you they loved your craft. They
gave you stickers and pizza and public praise.</p>
<p>They were not gaslighting you to be malicious. They were soothing you
to keep you functional.</p>
<p>The business saw that you, the Engineer, responded to words of
affirmation. They saw that you were willing to trade high-value
Intellectual Property for a “Good Job!” from a manager or skip. As a
rational economic actor, the Firm paid you in the currency you seemed to
value most: <strong>Validation.</strong></p>
<p>The Firm is not your enemy. The Firm is an amoral mirror. It issues
what you demand in proportion to what <em>value</em> you produce. If you
demand praise, they will pay you in praise. If you demand Status, they
will pay you in Status.</p>
<h2 id="price-discovery">4. Price Discovery</h2>
<p>This Manifesto is, ultimately, an instrument of <strong>Price
Discovery</strong>.</p>
<p>When you stop doing work that isn’t on the Firm Ledger, you are not
“quiet quitting.” You are correcting a market failure.</p>
<p>You are forcing the Firm to realize that “Quality,” “Maintenance,”
and “Mentorship” are not free, naturally occurring resources. They are
products. If the Firm wants them, they must pay for them with currency
that matters: <strong>Promotions and Budget.</strong></p>
<p>By optimizing for the calibration court you benefit yourself
immediately. But you also benefit the collective. You force the
organization to mature. You force it to align its incentives with its
actual survival needs. This is a bottom-up movement for agency.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-clarity">5. The Cost of Clarity</h2>
<p>There is a price to pay for this clarity.</p>
<p>You must endure the mental discomfort of dissociation. You must
detach your personal Moral Compass (The Private Ledger) from your
economic engine (The Firm Ledger).</p>
<p>You must accept that you can be “Right” (technically) and “Broke”
(politically) at the same time. You must accept that the Rating is the
Job.</p>
<p>It feels colder out here, outside the warm illusion of the “Work
Family.” But the air is cleaner. And the visibility is unlimited.</p>
<p>You are good at what you do.</p>
<p>People like us build and maintain the modern world.</p>
<p><strong>Stop doing it for free.</strong></p>
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<h3 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>The Firm Ledger</strong></p>
<p>The organization’s accounting of value. It does not track code
quality, effort, or moral virtue. It tracks <strong>Status-Weighted
Stories</strong>. If an action is not recorded here, it is chemically
indistinguishable from doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>The Private Ledger</strong></p>
<p>Your internal accounting of value, based on craft, ethics, and logic.
(e.g., “clean code,” “robust architecture”). Useful for mental health,
but useless for promotion. Do not expect the Firm Ledger to replicate
data from this table.</p>
<p><strong>Status (<span
class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>)</strong></p>
<p>The contextual importance of a <em>person</em> (<span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>). Someone who sits in the calibration
court has high Status. Someone who testifies has Status transitively
according to how the evaluators in that room view them.</p>
<p><strong>karma (<span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span>)</strong></p>
<p>A synonym for “affect” or “care”. How much good or bad feeling
<em>this person</em> (<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>) has about
the subject and is willing to testify to.</p>
<p><strong>Karma (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>)</strong></p>
<p>The sum of Status-weighted karma. (<span class="math inline">\(K =
\sum S_i \cdot k_i\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Status-Weighted Story</strong></p>
<p>The atomic unit of corporate currency. A narrative unit featuring
you, as told by someone with Status. Stories yield karma and are
weighted by the Status of the teller.</p>
<p><strong>KarmaRank</strong></p>
<p>The implied iterative algorithm by which Karma (<span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>) and Status (<span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) converge. That is, the outcome of
calibration confers title and accolades, which are components of Status.
Status is the realized effect of Karma validated by calibration.</p>
<h3 id="topology">Topology</h3>
<p><strong>The Calibration Cylinder</strong></p>
<p>The local network graph that determines your rating. It consists of
three layers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Defendant:</strong> You.</li>
<li><strong>The Counsel/Jury:</strong> Your Manager and their
Peers.</li>
<li><strong>The Judge:</strong> Your Skip-Level (Director/VP).</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone outside this cylinder is irrelevant to your immediate
survival.</p>
<p><strong>Frustum Culling</strong></p>
<p>A graphics rendering technique applied to social attention. The
practice of aggressively ignoring input, requests, or feedback from
individuals who do not have influence on your Calibration Cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>The Witness</strong></p>
<p>A High-Status individual (<span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>)
who has agreed to testify on your behalf during the calibration trial.
Without a Witness, your work is hearsay.</p>
<h3 id="tactics-workflows">Tactics &amp; Workflows</h3>
<p><strong>Karma-Driven Development (KDD)</strong></p>
<p>A development methodology where the “Test” (the promotion bullet
point) is written and validated <em>before</em> any code is written.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Protocol:</em> Groom Backlog → Write Test → Compiler Check →
Code (Green State) → Refactor Story.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Compiler Check</strong></p>
<p>The step in KDD where you validate a proposed “Status-Weighted Story”
with your Manager. If the Manager rejects the premise (<span
class="math inline">\(k_i \approx 0\)</span>), the code fails to compile
and must not be written.</p>
<p><strong>The Brief</strong></p>
<p>The final artifact of your work. A document formatted for the
“Numerophiles” in the calibration room. It must follow the structure:
<strong>Villain</strong> (Context) → <strong>Hero</strong> (Action) →
<strong>Witness</strong> (Validation) → <strong>Visual</strong>
(Chart).</p>
<p><strong>Political Echolocation</strong></p>
<p>The process of pinging High-Status nodes with strategic questions
(“What is your mental model of X?”) to populate your backlog with
high-demand stories and warm the cache for your identity.</p>
<h3 id="economics">Economics</h3>
<p><strong>Arbitrage</strong></p>
<p>The act of changing jobs to correct a market pricing error. If your
Private Ledger valuation (Senior Engineer) is higher than your Firm
Ledger valuation (Level 3), you execute a trade (change companies) to
capture the spread.</p>
<p><strong>The Loyalty Discount</strong></p>
<p>The economic penalty for remaining at a firm longer than two years.
Caused by the spread between the <strong>Retention Budget</strong> (Cost
of Living adjustments) and the <strong>Acquisition Budget</strong>
(Market Rate).</p>
<p><strong>Legacy Cache</strong></p>
<p>The accumulation of negative or neutral stories (“bugs,” “awkward
interactions”) that inevitably build up in your “Permanent Record” over
time. A primary driver for the necessity of <strong>Server
Migration</strong> (Job Hopping).</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>
<p>This manifesto is a synthesis of engineering pragmatism and social
science. If you want to inspect the source code for these ideas, start
here:</p>
<h3 id="pierre-bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</h3>
<p><em>The Logic of Practice</em> / <em>Distinction</em></p>
<p>The source of <strong>Field</strong>, <strong>Capital</strong>, and
<strong>Habitus</strong>. Bourdieu explains why some people “just get
it” (Habitus) and how social games are played for specific types of
Capital within a bounded Field.</p>
<h3 id="jonathan-haidt">Jonathan Haidt</h3>
<p><em>The Righteous Mind</em></p>
<p>The source of <strong>Moral Foundations Theory</strong>. Essential
for debugging <strong>Protocol Mismatches</strong>. It explains why your
“rational” argument for refactoring code (Sanctity/Order) sounds like
nonsense to a manager optimizing for quarterly revenue
(Authority/Outcome).</p>
<h3 id="james-c.-scott">James C. Scott</h3>
<p><em>Seeing Like a State</em></p>
<p>The definitive text on <strong>Legibility</strong>. It explains why
the Firm (like the State) must flatten complex reality into simple
metrics (Ratings), even if that simplification destroys local knowledge
and value.</p>
<h3 id="chris-voss">Chris Voss</h3>
<p><em>Never Split the Difference</em></p>
<p>The manual for <strong>Tactical Empathy</strong> and
<strong>Conversational Reconnaissance</strong>. Voss frames empathy not
as “niceness,” but as a way to extract information and influence
behavior using Calibrated Questions. This is the engine behind
<strong>Political Echolocation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="goodharts-law">Goodhart’s Law</h3>
<p>Marilyn Strathern</p>
<p><em>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure.”</em> The fundamental reason why <strong>Strategic
Ambiguity</strong> is a feature, not a bug, of performance review
systems.</p>
