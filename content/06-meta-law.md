# Meta-Law: You Do Not Talk About KarmaRank

You are allowed to play the game.  
You are not supposed to describe the game.

When I showed my manager the Net Status-Weighted Karma formula, she wasn't upset because the math was wrong. It was disempowering to see years of political savvy and emotional labor collapsed into a cold one-liner.

The modern firm is a social network made of _people_ who, like you, have their own pre-rational tastes, preferences and sacred cows. But unlike you, most people are unwilling to decouple their private ledger from the firm's—to see things clearly.

The modern firm needs to maintain a public religion of "merit," "impact," and "values." People have to be able to say, with a straight face, that performance ratings emerge from neutral evaluation of objective contributions. If you insist on talking about status weights and emotional payoff of stories, you are not "insightful." You are indecent.

From the inside, the rule looks like this:

> **You may act on the true objective function.  
> You may not name the true objective function.**

You are expected to translate your moves back into the house liturgy: "driving business outcomes," "raising the quality bar," "delighting users," "living the leadership principles." The closer your internal model gets to "I am maximizing high-status storytellers who enjoy endorsing me," the more aggressively you must wrap it in acceptable language.

This is not a conspiracy. It is a hygiene mechanism. If the firm acknowledged, openly, that your rating is a status-weighted sum of other people's feelings about you, half the building would quit and the rest would start playing even more nakedly political games. Strategic ambiguity keeps the story barely stable.

So you keep two layers:

* In your head, you run KarmaRank. You think in terms of fields, status weights, stories in flight.
* Out loud, you speak HR doxa. You think in terms of impact, customers, team success.

Violating Law #3 does not change how the system works. It only changes how the system categorizes you. Instead of "high-potential," you become "cynical," "political," or "not a culture fit."

This text is written in the forbidden dialect on purpose. Treat it like you would any other internal tool: useful in the debugger, suicidal in the release build.
