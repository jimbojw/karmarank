# Law #2: The Rating Is The Job

The firm does not pay you by the hour. And it certainly does not pay you "for the work."

The firm pays you an annualized total comp package, dripped out in biweekly installments, **for a portfolio of status-weighted stories about you** that your evaluators are willing to endorse.

From the firm's perspective, any effort that does not improve that portfolio is tantamount to **willful embezzlement**. You are quietly cashing their checks while investing your energy into a private ledger they neither see nor value.

Whether you internalize this moral framing as your own is your business. I'm not saying you _should_ treat your craft or your users as secondary.

I'm saying: **this is how the firm's operating system sees you**, as demonstrably encoded in their performance appraisal rituals. When you understand that, a lot of confusing decisions suddenly make sense.
