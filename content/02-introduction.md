# Introduction: The Frame of the Game
<!-- NAV_TITLE: @inherit -->

You are good at games. You understand games. Games have rules. Predictable, deterministic, if-this-then-that rules. If the rules are clear, you can play it.

Some games are "perfect knowledge", meaning no hidden information. Some games let players keep secrets. Some games have random outcomes. Some games even have rules that change as you go.

I'm going to ask you to entertain a wild idea. I want you to think of the modern workplace as a game, in which you are a professional player. How do you keep score? Who are your allies and opponents? What constitutes a foul, and what are the penalties?

When you sit down to a complex board game, you have certain expectations. Some resources will be easier to acquire, some less so. A player may stiff you on a trade, or play suboptimally. That's OK. Your own self-worth is intact. It's just a game.

In the pages that follow, I will reveal the hidden rules and unstated social physics of the corporate performance appraisal game. If you treat it with the same detached curiosity you bring to other gaming, you'll be fine. If you tie your self worth to _being right_, well, it's going to be more difficult.

Just like in other professional sports, how you play affects your greater life. Most directly in terms of comp, but also in terms of reputation, future opportunities, social sphere, mental health, etc. And so **playing ethically is the rational move**. But so may be the occasional strategic light foul.

The point is that you must separate your **Private Ledger**, what you think of as right and true and just, from the **Firm Ledger**, how the company (the firm) values your contributions.

It's not that your ethics don't matter in some abstract sense. It's that if you choose to commit a game-suboptimal play to satisfy your ethical frame, or vice versa, I want you to do it with eyes open. But to do that, you first have to understand the game you're already playing, which we'll explore thoroughly.

One final warning before we proceed: _you will feel manipulative_. We've been brought up to believe that unconscious prosocial behavior is "good" while conscious prosocial behavior is "suspicious", "manipulative", etc.

Unfortunately, to explain the rules and physics of the corporate appraisal game, this text must make social behavior and communication strategies **explicit**. You can think of our approach as going from vibes to debugger. Assistive technology for the empathetically disinclined.

Oh, and at the risk of undermining my own authority, I have _never been promoted within a company_. I don't believe in it. Strategically, the firm has every incentive to withhold increases in comp and level as long as possible.

So while I've worked in every size org from tiny startups to Big Tech, from academia to non-profit to B2B SaaS, I've found it way easier to boost my pay by hopping to a competitor, than to stay and grind it out for scraps.

But if that's you, no worries, the frameworks and techniques we'll develop here work equally well for effort minimization or outcome maximization. Just pick a lane and play accordingly.

With that out of the way, let's get on with our goal of mapping the firm's real moral and status drivers. This will reduce confusion, reduce unfair self-blame, and increase the karmic ROI of genuinely prosocial behavior.
