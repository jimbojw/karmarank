## Glossary

### The Laws

**Law #1: Conative Dissonance**

You are running two ledgers in one head (Private vs. Firm). The psychological friction experienced when these two databases drift apart is Conative Dissonance.

**Law #2: The Rating Is The Job**

The firm does not pay you for the work; it pays you for the **Status-Weighted Stories** about the work. Any effort not serialized into a rating is pro bono labor.

**Law #3: Who Cares?**

"Impact" is defined strictly as: *Who* ($S_i$) *Cares* ($k_i$). If you cannot name the specific high-status individuals who derive emotional value from your work, the impact is speculative.

**The Meta-Law**

You are allowed to play the game, but you must not describe the game. You must transubstantiate **KarmaRank** moves into HR Doxa ("business impact," "values") when speaking in public.

### Core Concepts

**Default Engineering Worldview (DEW)**

The vulnerable mental model that assumes meritocracy, logical consistency, and hard work are the primary drivers of corporate success. A legacy operating system that KarmaRank is designed to patch.

**The Firm Ledger**

The organization's accounting of value. It does not track effort or moral virtue. It tracks **Status-Weighted Stories**. If an action is not recorded here, it is chemically indistinguishable from doing nothing.

**Numerophiles**

People persuaded by numbers in the **Calibration Cylinder** (Directors/VPs). They are less persuaded by prose; they trust numbers and significant digits as proxies for truth.

**The Private Ledger**

Your internal accounting of value, based on craft, ethics, and logic. (e.g., "clean code," "robust architecture"). Useful for mental health, but useless for promotion. Do not expect the Firm Ledger to replicate data from this table.

**Red Queen's Race**

The evolutionary condition where one must constantly adapt just to maintain current standing. As KarmaRank tactics become popularized, the Firm will patch its exploits (deprecating "Impact"), requiring you to continuously reverse-engineer the new board.

**Status ($S_i$)**

The contextual importance of a _person_ ($i$). Someone who sits in the calibration court has high Status. Someone who testifies has Status transitively according to how the evaluators in that room view them.

**Strategic Ambiguity**

A security feature of the Firm. The intentional lack of clear, static promotion criteria to prevent Goodhart's Law (metric gaming) and strictly retain Leadership's veto power.

**karma ($k_i$)**

A synonym for "affect" or "care". How much good or bad feeling _this person_ ($i$) has about the subject and is willing to testify to.

**Karma ($K$)**

The sum of Status-weighted karma. ($K = \sum S_i \cdot k_i$).

**Status-Weighted Story**

The atomic unit of corporate currency. A narrative unit featuring you, as told by someone with Status. Stories yield karma and are weighted by the Status of the teller.

**The Uncanny Valley of Alignment**

The non-linear relationship between System Awareness and Organizational Alignment.

* **Idealists** align because they believe the nobel lie.
* **Burnouts** rebel because they reject the nobel lie.
* **Optimizers** align because they subvert the nobel lie.

**Full-Stack Human**

The result of an engineer applying their system-design skills to social dynamics. An individual who can both build value (Technical CPU) and sell value (Social GPU emulation), giving them an asymmetric advantage over pure politicians.

**KarmaRank**

Time-Decayed, Capital-Constrained, Adversarial Eigenvector-Sponsorship.

The implied iterative algorithm by which Karma ($K$) and Status ($S$) converge. That is, the outcome of calibration confers title and accolades, which are components of Status. Status is the realized effect of Karma validated by calibration.

### Archetypes

**The Technician**

The "Achievement" Manager. Driven by competence and efficiency. Currency: Accuracy. Trap: Do not bore them with "vision"; give them p99 latency stats.

**The Politician**

The "Power" Manager. Driven by influence and optics. Currency: Alignment. Trap: Do not bore them with technical nuance; connect your work to the VP's narrative.

**The Peacemaker**

The "Affiliation" Manager. Driven by harmony and connection. Currency: Safety. Trap: Most dangerous Counsel; will fold in court to avoid conflict. You must manufacture their spine.

**The Centaur Operator**

The post-AI engineer who uses LLMs ("The Humanities Compiler") to generate the empathy and social rhetoric they lack naturally. They do not rely on charisma; they spec charisma.

### Topology

**The Calibration Cylinder**

The local network graph that determines your rating. It consists of three layers:

1.  **The Defendant:** You.
2.  **The Counsel/Jury:** Your Manager and their Peers.
3.  **The Judge:** Your Skip-Level (Director/VP).

Anyone outside this cylinder is relevant only transitively (viewed from your cylinder’s constituent’s perspectives).

**Frustum Culling**

A graphics rendering technique applied to social attention. The practice of aggressively ignoring input, requests, or feedback from individuals who do not have influence on your Calibration Cylinder.

**The Witness**

A High-Status individual ($S_i$) who has agreed to testify on your behalf during the calibration trial. Without a Witness, your work is hearsay.

### Tactics & Workflows

**Karma-Driven Development (KDD)**

A development methodology where the "Test" (the promotion bullet point) is written and validated _before_ any code is written.

- _Protocol:_ Groom Backlog → Write Test → Compiler Check → Code (Green State) → Refactor Story.

**The Brief**

The final artifact of your work. A document formatted for the **Numerophiles** in the calibration room. It must follow the structure: **Villain** (Context) → **Hero** (Action) → **Witness** (Validation) → **Visual** (Chart).

**The IKEA Effect**

A cognitive bias where people overvalue things they helped create. A tactical exploit used to secure Witnesses: ask them to design the box so they are psychologically compelled to defend it.

**Political Echolocation**

The process of pinging High-Status nodes with strategic questions ("What is your mental model of X?") to populate your backlog with high-demand stories and warm the cache for your identity.

**The Visual Kill Shot**

A data visualization deployed to bypass the Jury's logical circuits and trigger a "competence" signal via the visual cortex. Used to prove "Up and To The Right."

### Economics

**Arbitrage**

The act of changing jobs to correct a market pricing error.

**The Loyalty Discount**

The economic penalty for remaining at a firm longer than two years. Caused by the spread between the **Retention Budget** (Cost of Living adjustments) and the **Acquisition Budget** (Market Rate).

**Legacy Cache**

The accumulation of negative or neutral stories ("bugs," "awkward interactions") that inevitably build up in your record over time. A primary driver for the necessity of **Server Migration** (Job Hopping).

## Further Reading

This manifesto is a synthesis of engineering pragmatism and social science. If you want to inspect the source code for these ideas, start here:

### Pierre Bourdieu

_The Logic of Practice_ / _Distinction_

The source of **Field**, **Capital**, and **Habitus**. Bourdieu explains why some people "just get it" (Habitus) and how social games are played for specific types of Capital within a bounded Field.

### David McClelland

_Human Motivation_

The source of **Need Theory**. Essential for debugging **Motivation Mismatches**. It explains why your "rational" argument for refactoring code (Achievement) sounds like nonsense to a manager optimizing for organizational influence (Power) or team harmony (Affiliation).

### James C. Scott

_Seeing Like a State_

The definitive text on **Legibility**. It explains why the Firm (like the State) must flatten complex reality into simple metrics (Ratings), even if that simplification destroys local knowledge and value.

### Chris Voss

_Never Split the Difference_

The manual for **Tactical Empathy** and **Conversational Reconnaissance**. Voss frames empathy not as "niceness," but as a way to extract information and influence behavior using Calibrated Questions. This is the engine behind **Political Echolocation**.

### Goodhart's Law

Marilyn Strathern

_"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."_ The fundamental reason why **Strategic Ambiguity** is a feature, not a bug, of performance review systems.
