# Appendix: Glossary

## Core Concepts

**The Firm Ledger**

The organization's accounting of value. It does not track code quality, effort, or moral virtue. It tracks **Status-Weighted Stories**. If an action is not recorded here, it is chemically indistinguishable from doing nothing.

**The Private Ledger**

Your internal accounting of value, based on craft, ethics, and logic. (e.g., "clean code," "robust architecture"). Useful for mental health, but useless for promotion. Do not expect the Firm Ledger to replicate data from this table.

**Status-Weighted Story**

The atomic unit of corporate currency. A narrative about your work that is endorsed by contextually high-status individuals.

* *Formula:* `Value = Story * Witness_Status`

**KarmaRank ($K$)**

The algorithm that determines your "Impact."

* **Formula:** $K = \sum S_i \cdot k_i$
* **$S_i$ (Status):** The political weight of a person in your network.
* **$k_i$ (Caring):** The emotional value they derive from telling a story about you.

## Topology

**The Calibration Cylinder**

The local network graph that determines your rating. It consists of three layers:

1.  **The Defendant:** You.
2.  **The Counsel/Jury:** Your Manager and their Peers.
3.  **The Judge:** Your Skip-Level (Director/VP).

Anyone outside this cylinder is irrelevant to your immediate survival.

**Frustum Culling**

A graphics rendering technique applied to social attention. The practice of aggressively ignoring input, requests, or feedback from individuals who do not have influence on your Calibration Cylinder.

**The Witness**

A High-Status individual ($S_i$) who has agreed to testify on your behalf during the calibration trial. Without a Witness, your work is hearsay.

## Tactics & Workflows

**Karma-Driven Development (KDD)**

A development methodology where the "Test" (the promotion bullet point) is written and validated *before* any code is written.

* *Protocol:* Groom Backlog → Write Test → Compiler Check → Code (Green State) → Refactor Story.

**The Compiler Check**

The step in KDD where you validate a proposed "Status-Weighted Story" with your Manager. If the Manager rejects the premise ($k_i \approx 0$), the code fails to compile and must not be written.

**The Brief**

The final artifact of your work. A document formatted for the "Numerophiles" in the calibration room. It must follow the structure: **Villain** (Context) → **Hero** (Action) → **Witness** (Validation) → **Visual** (Chart).

**Political Echolocation**

The process of pinging High-Status nodes with strategic questions ("What is your mental model of X?") to populate your backlog with high-demand stories and warm the cache for your identity.

## Economics

**Arbitrage**

The act of changing jobs to correct a market pricing error. If your Private Ledger valuation (Senior Engineer) is higher than your Firm Ledger valuation (Level 3), you execute a trade (change companies) to capture the spread.

**The Loyalty Discount**

The economic penalty for remaining at a firm longer than two years. Caused by the spread between the **Retention Budget** (Cost of Living adjustments) and the **Acquisition Budget** (Market Rate).

**Legacy Cache**

The accumulation of negative or neutral stories ("bugs," "awkward interactions") that inevitably build up in your "Permanent Record" over time. A primary driver for the necessity of **Server Migration** (Job Hopping).
