# Know Your Counsel: Technician, Politician, Peacemaker

In the preceding chapter, you saw the Calibration Cylinder—the relevant local topology of your corporate social graph. We discussed how calibration operates like a courtroom, a trial in absentia, with your manager performing the role of your public defender (Counsel).

The other managers in the room are the Prosecution/Jury. The Skip Level is the Judge. The budget for promotions and raises is the settlement fund.

To secure your best defense, you’ll want to Know Your Counsel (KYC). This will allow you to select projects and frame Status-Weighted Stories in the native schema of your particular cylinder.

In the engineering world, managers generally fall into one of three archetypes: the Technician, the Politician, and the Peacemaker. Every person is different, but these are the abstract base classes.

## 1. The Technician (The "Achievement" Manager)

**The Psychology:**
This manager is driven by **Competence**. They view the team as a machine and themselves as the Chief Architect. They care about efficiency, mastery, and "doing it right." They are allergic to fluff, marketing speak, and emotional appeals. They are often former Senior Engineers who were Peter-Principled into management.

**The Litmus Test:**
* **The 1:1 Test:** Do they naturally ask "Are you blocked?" (Process) or "How are you feeling?" (People)?
* **The Risk Test:** How do they react to a hacky hotfix? If they visibly wince and demand a refactor ticket immediately, they are a Technician.
* **The Praise Test:** They light up when you mention latency reduction or code deletion. They gloss over "great cross-team collaboration."

**The Interaction Protocol:**
* **Currency:** Accuracy & Efficiency.
* **Day-to-Day:** Speak in integers. Do not tell them you "improved" the system; tell them you "reduced build times by 14%."
* **The Trap:** Do not try to dazzle them with "Vision." They will drill down into the implementation details until they find a flaw, and then they will stop trusting you.

**How they argue in court:**
"My client’s output is 20% higher than the L5 baseline. The data demands a promotion. If we don't promote them, our leveling rubric is invalid."

## 2. The Politician (The "Power" Manager)

**The Psychology:**
This manager is driven by **Influence**. Do not confuse them with a "Climber" who just wants a raise. They view the team as an operational sphere and a stepping stone to the next level of organizational control. They care about "optics," "alignment," and "visibility." They want to be seen as a Kingmaker who grooms future leaders.

**The Litmus Test:**
* **The 1:1 Test:** Do they spend 15 minutes talking about what the VP said in the All-Hands?
* **The Risk Test:** How do they react to a project that has high technical value but zero visibility? They will likely kill it or starve it of resources.
* **The Praise Test:** They light up when you mention you presented to another team or "unblocked the Director's initiative."

**The Interaction Protocol:**
* **Currency:** Status & Alignment.
* **Day-to-Day:** Connect your work to the "Narrative." Never just fix a bug; always "remove a blocker for the Q3 Strategy." Name-drop the people they want to impress.
* **The Trap:** Do not bore them with technical nuance. If you explain the complexity of the database migration, their eyes will glaze over. Tell them *who* the migration helps.

**How they argue in court:**
"My client isn't just coding; they are driving the VP’s Q3 strategy. Promoting them solidifies our department's leadership in this domain."

## 3. The Peacemaker (The "Affiliation" Manager)

**The Psychology:**
This manager is driven by **Connection**. They view the team as a family. They care about morale, retention, and everyone getting along. **Warning:** This is the most dangerous attorney to have. In a calibration fight, they are prone to folding early to avoid conflict with their peers. They value their relationship with the other managers more than they value winning your case.

**The Litmus Test:**
* **The 1:1 Test:** Do they spend the first 20 minutes chatting about your weekend or your hobbies?
* **The Risk Test:** How do they react to you having a conflict with another team? They will immediately try to "smooth it over" rather than fighting for your side.
* **The Praise Test:** They light up when you mention mentorship, onboarding new hires, or organizing team socials.

**The Interaction Protocol:**
* **Currency:** Harmony & Safety.
* **Day-to-Day:** Position yourself as the "Glue." Highlight how you help others. If you are aggressive or competitive, they will view you as a threat to the tribe's stability.
* **The Trap:** Do not rely on them to be aggressive for you. You must manufacture the spine they lack.

**How they argue in court:**
"My client is the glue holding the team together. If we don't recognize them, we risk morale issues and attrition."

## 4. Archetype Disambiguation: The Book Bank-Shot

I should warn you not to be too hasty in putting your manager into one specific bucket. For example, many managers will ask you “how are you feeling?” as an opener. This doesn’t mean they’re Peacemakers necessarily.

As we discussed, the [Default Engineering Worldview](./04-security-advisory.md#security-advisory-five-vulnerabilities-in-the-default-engineering-worldview) has left your peers with copious, free-floating cognitive dissonance. Consequently, managers often have to become untrained therapists.

Likewise, even if your manager is a natural Technician or Peacemaker, to be effective they’ll have learned (or been trained) to emulate Politician-speak. You’ll observe them using words like “impact” and “visibility” even if their heart is elsewhere.

So don’t fixate on the first words that come out of their mouth (“How are you?”) or when they’re delivering manager-role canned lines (“Let’s discuss milestones for Q3.”). To reverse engineer their archetype, you may have to collect subtle cues over time.

Or pull off a conversational bank-shot. You might start by asking them a mentorship question, like a book recommendation. Their answer will be a mix of their own taste and what they think would benefit you specifically.

Possible examples:

* **Technician:** The Mythical Man-Month, Designing Data-Intensive Applications, or a specific language reference. (Focus: Craft).
* **Politician:** The First 90 Days, High Output Management, 7 Habits. (Focus: Effectiveness/Strategy).
* **Peacemaker:** Radical Candor, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Nonviolent Communication. (Focus: Human Dynamics).

When you follow up with “how was this book transformative _for you_?”, you open the floor for them to reveal who the _were_ and who they _wanted to become_. This should strongly indicate their dominant managerial archetype.

Now that you have identified who you are trying to impress (the court) and who will be delivering that defense (your manager), it’s time to learn what to _do_. This brings us to **Karma-Driven Development.**
