# Law #3: Who Cares?
<!-- NAV_TITLE: @inherit -->

"Impact" is a fluff word.

People say "impact" the way astrologers say "energy": a vague scalar that is always supposed to be "higher" than last year. It sounds serious. It explains nothing.

Under KarmaRank, "impact" has a very specific implementation:

> **Impact = Who Cares?**

Literally: who $(S_i)$ cares $(k_i)$.

* "Who" = which people in the field have non-zero Status with respect to your rating.
* "Cares" = how much emotional and political value they get from telling a story where you are the hero.

Written as math, your capital-I **Impact** to the firm is just your Net Status-Weighted Karma:

$$
K = \sum_i S_i \cdot k_i
$$

If nobody with Status cares, the system has nowhere to store your so-called "impact". It lives only on your Private Ledger as a pleasant feeling about yourself.

This gives you a simple test:

* "I improved test coverage" → Who cares?
* "I made the UI nicer" → Who cares?
* "I cut cold-start time by 40% for Team X's workflow" → Who, by name, is going to care enough to say that out loud in a calibration room?

If you cannot answer "who cares?" (with names, not archetypes), you are doing **speculative impact**. To you, it may be good. It may be virtuous. It may even be useful in some cosmic hard-to-measure sense. But as far as the Firm Ledger is concerned, it does not exist yet.

Law #3 is the operational version of Law #2.  
"The rating is the job" tells you what gets serialized.  
"Who Cares?" tells you how to decide where to spend your next hour.
